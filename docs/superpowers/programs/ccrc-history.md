# Program: ccrc-history

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-ccrc-history-lossless-dag-design.md` (rev 3.2, operator-approved design;
rulings Q1–Q14 of 2026-10-05; Q15–Q19 open)
Plans: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-05-ccrc-history-w1-capture.md` (waves 1 and 2: W1 Part A and W1-B1). The plans
for W1-B2, B3 and B4 are written by the coordinator while earlier waves run.
Home project: `ccrc-pwa`   Coordinator: `ccrc-pwa-quiet-ridge`   Workspace: **a fresh child per wave** (one PR per child)

**What this program is.** ccrc keeps its own lossless, searchable copy of every Claude Code session transcript on
each box that hosts sessions, and gives a session a way to recall what it compacted away: a per-box SQLite store
(node:sqlite + FTS5) fed by a sole-writer indexer from hook spool lines, a DAG of summaries (native leaves first,
session-written leaves in W3), and a `ccrc history` CLI plus a skill. Modelled on lossless-claw (MIT), ported rather
than depended on (spec §11–§12). A replay eval (W2) decides whether W3 and W4 ship at all.

## Waves

| # | scope | deploy class | PRs | state |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | W1 Part A: Node floor `>=22.16.0` in the three engines, node-floor assertion 4, the `node floor (22.16.0)` CI leg (plan Tasks 1–2) | engines + CI; full suite | — | run 293 opened 2026-10-06 |
| 2 | W1-B1 "capture": `lib.mjs`, `store.mjs`, `sweep.mjs`, the shim, the hook's spool line, journal + pre-migration snapshot + purge carve-out, `status`, install/uninstall/deploy, doctor `history`, lifecycle rows, `measure-history.py` (plan Tasks 3–36). Sessions see no change | fleet (shim + timer); full suite (package.json via Part A already merged) | — | planned after wave 1 merges |
| 3 | W1-B2 "recall": read verbs, parser, native leaves, the skill, operator verbs (`prune`, `doctor --repair/--backup/--adopt/--restore/--rebuild/--migrate`, `reparse`), recovery step | fleet + skills | — | plan owed (coordinator) |
| 4 | W1-B3 "card line": scope marker, `_hook_history_card`, the S6-R11 census re-measure | fleet (hook) | — | plan owed; after wave 3 |
| 5 | W1-B4 "sole-copy export" (ruled Q6, e) | fleet | — | plan owed; after wave 3; **live on every session-hosting node before the earliest W1-k date, at the latest 2026-12-19** |
| 6 | W2: the headless seam, the replay driver, the quiz and the live A/B; the gate (ruled Q7, Q14) | fleet | — | after waves 3 and the backfill |
| 7 | W3: steering (session-written leaves) | fleet (hook) | — | only if the W2 gate passes |
| 8 | W4: subagents and `touched` | fleet | — | only if the W2 gate passes, and never before wave 5 is live |

## Decisions & deviations

- **Operator rulings 2026-10-05** (spec §15.1): Q1 fixed root + `db/` symlink; Q2 spool on PostCompact, Stop,
  SessionStart(startup|resume|clear); Q3 many fleet and many server boxes (one store per session-hosting box, none on
  a server box); Q4 the disk spec's `history` role; Q5 exact span partition; Q6 backup = pre-migration snapshot +
  retained journal + purge keeps the store + restore/rebuild in W1, sole-copy export before retention bites, no
  scheduled full copies; Q7 cluster-bootstrap gate; Q8 recall on every provider and lane, surviving provider
  migration; Q9 archive-quoted gists; Q10–Q14 as recommended.
- **Open operator questions Q15–Q19** (spec §15.3). Every wave follows the spec's stated default until answered:
  Q15 the ruled node-shortest export reducer (planExport takes per-file pairs, so a yes swaps one reducer); Q16 no
  `fork` spooling; Q17 the recommended purge wording (no behaviour change); Q18 is W2's; Q19 no hand-mapping mode.
- **Coordinator rulings at plan review (2026-10-06):** R1 — `sweep.mjs` and `cli.mjs` end in their entry guard, with
  no top-level await, and every later block is inserted above it; R2 — redaction catches a `RangeError` from the
  shape regexes on a multi-MiB run and redacts the whole run (fail closed), pinned at 16 MiB; R3 — a `statfs` that
  throws reads `low-disk` (spec §9.10's failure table).
- **How the plan was checked.** Eight batch reviewers, an integration reviewer and a refute pass per reviewer, then
  two smoke runs that transcribed every task into a throwaway worktree at `d12b5aba0` and ran it: every new
  history suite and every existing suite the plan edits passed (the one red, `tmp-sweep`, is red at the base too).
- **Departures.** The wave-1 plan's 95 departures were issued in one block by the allocator on 2026-10-06 (95
  numbers starting at D-4165) and are defined in the plan's `## Deviations found`, each beside its spec §16 slug.
  Each wave's run gets its own small block at run-open, named in its brief and written bare here until a plan on
  `main` defines it: run 293 (wave 1) holds deviations 4260, 4261, 4262, 4263, 4264 and 4265.
- **Routing (clause 13).** Wave 1 is a dependent chain that fits one context: Opus · high main loop, Sonnet · high
  implementers, Opus · high per-task reviewer, workflows off, `compact 40`. Wave 2 (34 tasks) outgrows one context:
  the bulk row — Opus · ultracode orchestrating, Sonnet · high workers (implementation never below Sonnet · high),
  workflows on.

## Carried constraints

- **Order.** Part A merges first, with the full suite (any `package.json` or `.github/` edit selects it). B1 needs
  the 22.16 leg and the engines floor on its base.
- **Before wave 2 converges anywhere:** on each session-hosting node that keeps its store on a volume, the operator
  links `~/.ccrc/history/db` onto it (spec §9.3: a 0700 root and target) before that node converges, or doctor FAILs.
  After merge, the operator runs the shim's `--op import --apply` from a shell (B1 has no CLI `import`).
- **Operator acts Part A names:** a read-only `node --version` on every node before Part A merges; optionally making
  `node floor (22.16.0)` a required check.
- **Disk-hygiene W2 is not on `main`.** Its pins O30/O31 join whichever of B1 and disk-hygiene W2 lands second
  (plan Task 34 holds the code). The disk spec (`2026-10-03-fleet-disk-hygiene-design.md`) is still on the
  coordinator's branch, awaiting the operator's review; it is not part of this programme.
- **The volume.** `~/.cc-tmp` leaks ccrc test fixtures (2,327 dirs older than 60 min on 2026-10-06); every wave's
  suites add to it until disk-hygiene wave 1 lands. Workers clean up the fixtures their own runs create.
- **Merge conflicts to expect** (spec §10.6): disk-hygiene W2 and GPT-lane Part 3a/3b edit `ccd/ccrc-doctor-checks`;
  landing-order and continuity edit `ccd/session-hook.sh`. The plan's line anchors are at `d12b5aba0`; a worker
  re-anchors by content on its own base.

## Next-wave brief

Wave 1 (W1 Part A) is the first dispatch; its brief is the run's dispatch text. Wave 2's brief is written here
when wave 1 closes.
