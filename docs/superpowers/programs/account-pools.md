# Program: account-pools

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-account-pools-design.md` (approved by the operator 2026-09-05)
Plan: six wave plans, written and numbered before the program opened —
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-05-account-pools-wave{1-roster,2a-ccd-tag-placement,2b-ccd-swap-strand-crossing,3-server,4-pwa,5-docs}.md`
Workspace: worker workspace spawned by wave 1's dispatch (recorded in the Waves table once it exists)
Coordinator: `ccrc-pwa-amber-summit` (workspace `amber-summit`, branch `ws/amber-summit`) — operator-designated
2026-09-05 ("Subagent driven, and leverage CCRC capabilities fully"). Workspace-resident, not a main checkout.

The spec, the six plans and this ledger were merged to `main` BEFORE wave 1 was dispatched (docs PR from
`ws/amber-summit`), so every worker workspace is cut with its requirements in the tree — no ref-fetching.
This ledger keeps moving on `ws/amber-summit` (pushed after every wave) and lands on `main` with the final wave.

Execution shape, every wave: the worker invokes `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` on its own
workspace branch — fresh implementer subagent per task, task review after each, whole-branch review at the
end — then pushes, opens the PR and mails `wave-done`. The coordinator re-measures, reviews the PR with an
independent lens, merges, deploys (agent-first where the wave says so), and briefs the next wave.

Ledger block: **D-1663–D-1688** — minted in ONE allocator call on 2026-09-05 at plan time (floor 1689) and
FULLY DEFINED across the six plans (wave 4 defines none). It is not a reserve: a deviation found during
execution gets its own allocator call (see Decisions, "execution-time deviations").

## Waves

| # | scope | PRs | state |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Roster substrate: `AccountDef.pool` + `POOL_NAME_RE`, the bare-`node` mirror (closes D-1663), `_ccrc_pool()` in `accounts.sh`, `RosterWire.pool` + project-pool wire vocabulary, `shared/poolrule.ts` (D-1664), fixture table. NOT agent-first (touches nothing under `ccd/`). | — | planned 2026-09-05 |
| 2a | `ccd` reader + `project-pool` verb + `_pool_ok` + placement + agent grant + `POOLS_CAP` + doctor + `rehome`. AGENT-FIRST. | — | not opened |
| 2b | `ccd` deciders: auto-swap tick, strand, crossing marker, four manual verbs. AGENT-FIRST. | — | not opened |
| 3 | Server L1/L3 (`pools.ts`, `poolrule.ts` wrapper), registry `stranded`, routes, watcher frame, health. | — | not opened |
| 4 | PWA: `accountPool`, `splitByPool`, `PoolSheet`, chips, sheets, store slot. Defines no deviation. | — | not opened |
| 5 | README, `CLAUDE.md`, `config.ts` / `ccd` comment corrections. | — | not opened |

## Decisions & deviations

- **Program shape (2026-09-05):** the operator chose subagent-driven execution and asked that ccrc's own
  capabilities be used fully. Ruling: the program runs through the coordination machinery — one run row per
  wave, a dispatched worker per wave in ONE workspace (resumed and `/clear`ed by dispatch from wave 2a on),
  briefs by mail, `wave-done` re-measured by the server, items settled only after `advance` answers `ok`.
  The worker runs SDD inside its wave; the coordinator never does a wave's own work. Costs if wrong: a
  dispatch machinery stall costs a wave's wall-clock, never its code — the plans stand on their own.
- **Docs merged first (2026-09-05):** the plans were finished and approved before execution, so they go to
  `main` in a docs-only PR ahead of wave 1 rather than living on the coordinator's branch for workers to
  fetch (the program-leverage/registry-durability precedent, D-108, existed because those plans were written
  per wave). Consequence: `deviation-refs` on every wave branch compares the same plan set against `main`
  — trivially green — and the plans' `Base: origin/main 2b15144e` line is provenance, not the base a wave is
  cut from (dispatch bases on `origin/HEAD` at spawn time).
- **Execution-time deviations (2026-09-05):** coordinator clause 10 (a worker never calls the allocator
  mid-wave) and the plans' Global Constraint (an execution-time deviation is allocated the moment it is
  found) are reconciled as: the worker writes the full entry under `D-TBD-<slug>` in the wave plan's
  `## Deviations found`, mails the coordinator (`kind:status`, `subject:deviation-request`, the slugs and
  count, this wave's `runId`), the coordinator mints exactly that many with `ccrc-api ledger allocate` and
  mails the numbers back (`kind:answer`), and the worker substitutes before `wave-done`. `dtbd.test.ts`
  refuses any surviving placeholder, so a PR cannot go green with one. No spare numbers are pre-minted —
  a minted number is defined in the same act or not minted.
- **Concurrent program:** `battlescape-operational` (MekWarLive, run 31, wave 8/9) is active. Every
  `toId:'coordinator'` mail in this program MUST carry this wave's `runId`; the runId-less form resolves
  only when exactly one program is active. Briefs restate this.
- **Deploy after wave 1:** not agent-first. Server lane only, from the merge sha; `accounts.sh` regenerates
  with `_ccrc_pool` on the fleet box only when the agent lane ships (wave 2a), so `rosterAgreement` may read
  `divergent` between the two — spec §5.3 names this as expected and the banner's remedy stands.

## Carried constraints

- Fixture pool names are `pool-a`, `pool-b` (`pool-ab` once, wave 1 Task 5) — never a real pool or account
  name in any tracked file. `topology-clean` and `single-definition` scan the whole tracked tree.
- `FLEET_PROTO` stays 1; every new field is additive with ONE reader; older-peer omission tolerated.
- No overloaded null at a seam: `unreadable` / `malformed` / `untagged` stay distinct everywhere.
- `EXEC_COMMANDS = ['tmux','ccd']` stays closed; no `gh` grant, ever.
- L0 `shared/*.ts` imports nothing (not even `node:*` types); `shared/poolrule.ts` imports only types from `./api.js`.
- Every guard ships with a test measured RED on its deletion — before and after, not asserted.

## Next-wave brief

Wave 1 — see the dispatch record in the Waves row once sent; the brief text is reproduced here at dispatch so
a revived coordinator reads what the worker read.
