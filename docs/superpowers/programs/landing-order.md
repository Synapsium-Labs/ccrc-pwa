# Program: landing-order

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-23-landing-order-and-main-churn-design.md`
Plans: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-2?-landing-order-wave<N>-*.md` — each written once the waves it depends on
have landed what it reads
Home project: `ccrc-pwa`   Coordinator: `ccrc-pwa-quiet-river` (assigned by the operator 2026-10-02)   Workspace: **a fresh one per wave**
Ticket: `CCR-19` (Linear; mirrored as GitHub issue #198) — the coordinator is created from it
Companion programme: `docs/superpowers/programs/session-continuity.md`

**What this program is.** The fleet manufactures main churn — ritual syncs, `update-branch`, repeat absorptions —
and lands in whatever order merges happen to arrive, testing no composition. This programme stops the churn,
makes landing order a recorded fact, and lets the coordinator land a tested composition. **The coordinator
merges, workers never do, and nothing merges unattended** (spec §3, R5). The operator's rulings are the spec's §3
(R1–R10); every §11 decision was ruled on 2026-09-23.

## Waves

| # | spec stage | scope | deploy class | depends on | PRs | state |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | worker clause 16 and coordinator clause 15 with their pins and count words; the PreToolUse advisory on syncs of `main`; `ccrc restamp`; `update-branch` pinned absent from executable source and counted in the skills | skills, hook (fleet box) | — | #231 | fix round 2 done 2026-10-02; in re-review (run 235) |
| 2 | 2, repository code | `ci.yml` gains `merge_group`, the macOS skip and a `pull_request` concurrency group; `pr-state`'s `queue` field; the dequeue feed event and coordinator mail; the hook denies `gh pr merge` to workers; clause 15's native-queue sentence | ccd, hook, server | wave 1; child-reclamation wave 3 | — | re-planned 2026-09-29; dispatch after wave 1 merges |
| 2b | 2, the bypass deny | the hook denies `--admin` and a `gh api` merge call in every fleet session | hook | the operator's queue ruleset, approvals at 0, and the proof run | — | to plan |
| 3 | 3 | `ccd-land-probe`, the read-only conflict radar, and its opt-in mirror | ccd, deploy | — | — | to plan |
| 4 | 4 | the opted-in lineage table; `lineage-unmeasured` | server | wave 3 | — | to plan |
| 5 | 5 | the landing line: entries, intents, holds, `land-candidate`, the coordinator's pinned merge, the PWA doors | server, ccd, skills, pwa | waves 2–4; session-continuity wave 1 | — | to plan |

**A fresh workspace per wave (R4) is child-reclamation's.** The spec first drew it as step 6 of the wave lifecycle,
gated on CCR-15 wave 3. CCR-15 wave 2 (#178) made it live on `main` as "One PR per child", so wave 1 no longer
carries it (spec §5.1, amended 2026-09-24).

## Decisions & deviations

- **2026-09-23 — the design, its rulings and the written spec.** Approved in the brainstorm (R1–R8); the operator
  ruled both open decisions on the written spec the same day: break-glass keeps the repository-admin role as the
  ruleset's only bypass actor (R9); strict protection comes off intake-platform and data-internal after a week of
  coordinator landings with composition tests (R10).
- **2026-09-23 — stage 2 split into two waves.** The spec's own rollout order puts the `--admin` deny after the
  operator's ruleset change and the proof run (§5.2 steps 2–4), so it ships as wave 2b rather than behind a flag in
  wave 2. Not a deviation — the spec's order, drawn as waves.
- **2026-09-24 — the Maintain-role bypass comes off.** The operator confirmed the removal wave 2's runbook makes
  (Task 7 Step 4) when it adds the queue rule: the repository-admin role stays the ruleset's only bypass actor.
- **2026-09-24 — execution: coordinator dispatch.** The operator creates one coordinator per programme from its
  ticket. Each wave goes to a fresh worker workspace running subagent-driven development, a review run reads the
  worker's branch, and the coordinator rules and merges; the plans reach a worker only from `main`, so the docs
  PR carrying the specs, the ledgers and the first four plans merges before the first dispatch.
- **2026-09-24 — the plans re-measured against `main` `b501698a`.** Main moved three commits after review (#176,
  #178, #179). Both plans' counts and line hints were re-measured and corrected. Step 6 left wave 1: child-reclamation
  delivered it. Wave 2's Tasks 3–5 are re-planned after child-reclamation wave 3 merges: under "One PR per child" a
  producer's run closes before its PR merges and wave 3 reclaims its workspace. So the dequeue lane has no open run
  or registry row to key on. The landing spelling must keep `--match-head-commit`, and the merge deny has a window
  (the plan's status block names the directions).
- **2026-09-28 — the plans re-measured against `main` `c62e22b9`; two rulings.** Nine commits landed after 2026-09-24
  (#182–#186, #192–#195). Eight opus agents re-checked every tree-dependent claim, a second per plan re-ran each. Wave 1:
  numbers only, except that CI test selection (#183) took away trigger 2's evidence — a push to main now runs no test
  legs and reports every required check green. **Ruled by the operator:** trigger 2 reads "a required check is red while
  main passes the same tests", measured by re-running the failing test files on a clean `origin/HEAD` (spec §5.1); Tasks 3
  and 5 re-measured with it. `measure-landing.py main-red` stays valid for the frozen baseline only; stage 2 reads
  red-main from runs that ran the required legs, or refuses a window crossing `814fc53d`. Wave 2: #183 landed first and
  reshaped `ci.yml`, so Task 1 and Task 7's precondition join Tasks 3–5 in the re-plan. **Ruled by the operator:** a
  merge-queue run runs the selected tests, like a PR.
- **2026-09-28 (evening) — wave 1 re-measured again against `023fe94d`.** Child-reclamation wave 3 (#187) and
  update-management wave 4 (#181) merged after `c62e22b9`. #181 rewrote `ccrc`'s usage line (`rollback`, `channel`,
  `watchdog`), so Task 2's usage edit, its `ccrc-cli` regex and mutation row R5 are restated on the new line and
  re-measured (`ccrc-restamp` 7|1 then 8/8, `ccrc-cli` 1|34 then 35/35). Wave 3 now lands first, so its skill `it`
  blocks are part of the base and Task 3 inserts below them with no conflict; everything else moved only in numbers.
  With #187 merged, wave 2's Tasks 3–5 re-plan is unblocked.
- **2026-09-29 — wave 2 re-planned; four operator rulings.** Re-planned prototype-first on `main` `6da36f0b` with wave 1
  applied, three independent opus reviews (21 findings, one blocker: gh 2.45 ARMS auto-merge rather than queueing a PR
  whose required checks have not passed, with the same success line), one fix round and an independent verification.
  The landing lane keys on the open run, a `merged:#<n>` mail wakes a coordinator waiting at `merging`, the merge deny
  also reads the child marker, the producer lands before its close (the last wave too), every landing binds
  `--match-head-commit`, and the coordinator enqueues only once the required checks pass and reads the queue entry
  back. **Ruled by the operator:** an independent wave N+1 still dispatches only after wave N closes; the `merged:`
  mail is in; the 2026-09-24 25 s `pr-state` ruling stands (a close's worst case is now about 50 s); and if the proof
  run's enqueue is refused because `allow_auto_merge` is off, stop rule 4 halts and the operator decides. The spec
  (§4–§6, §9) is amended to match. Wave 1's usage-line edits now anchor on the `|expose|version|` fragment, because
  the verb list grew again (#202's `versions`); re-measured on `cf24e4be`: `ccrc-restamp` 7|1 then 8/8, `ccrc-cli`
  1|34 then 35/35.
- **2026-10-02 — the coordinator assigned.** The operator made session `ccrc-pwa-quiet-river` — the planning session
  that wrote this programme's plans — the coordinator of landing-order, session-continuity and workspace-lifecycle
  together. Each wave is its own run under that session id; a fresh coordinator resumes only under the same id
  (the coordinator skill's `references/resume.md`). Wave 1 dispatches now; wave 2 after wave 1 merges (the 2026-09-29 ruling).
- **2026-10-02 — wave 1 dispatched as run 218** to a fresh workspace (`ccrc-pwa-swift-prairie`, branch `ws/swift-prairie`),
  executing by subagent-driven development on the matrix's "worker executing a spec'd plan" row (Opus · high,
  Sonnet · high implementers, an Opus · high reviewer per task, workflow off, compact 40). Its deviation
  numbers, issued at run-open and written bare here until a plan on the same ref defines them: 3758 through 3767.
  The brief adds two rules that post-date the plan: the wave stops at the PR (the coordinator merges; the
  fleet moves by ccrc's own update mechanism, operator ruling 2026-09-30), and main is measured fresh.
- **2026-10-02 — peer agreement with stall-watch on the skill clauses.** Stall-watch's coordinator
  (`ccrc-pwa-calm-harbor`) wrote about its wave 4 (run 226). That wave adds a coordinator clause and a worker clause.
  It will leave the skill files alone until this programme's wave 1 merges, then renumber its own clauses (spec
  2026-09-29 §10: whoever lands second moves the count words). Wave 1 keeps coordinator clause 15 and worker
  clause 16.
  - **Owed on merge:** a one-line mail to `ccrc-pwa-calm-harbor`.
  - **The peer's second finding.** The plan moves three of the five `fourteen` occurrences in
    `coordinator-skill.test.ts`. The two it leaves (about `:146` and `:181`) are comments, which no test reads, so
    they cannot red. Ruled: update both in clause 15's commit, as a departure from run 218's block.
- **2026-10-02 — wave 1 done, in review.** Run 218's wave-done (PR #231, tip `1f688879`) passed the server's
  re-measurement. The run is at `awaiting-review` and its seven items are settled.
  - **Departures.** The worker used 3758 through 3764 from its block, each defined in the plan on the branch. 3765
    through 3767 went unused.
  - **Merge state.** The branch has not merged main `cf9e4cc8`. Its merge-tree probe there is clean.
  - **Skipped step.** Task 7 Step 6 (rollout) was skipped by standing rule. The deploy is owed after the merge,
    through ccrc's own update mechanism, fleet box first.
  - **Signals:** `suite: red`, `failure: shallow`. The branch's own red was modelenv-single-writer: Task 2's restamp
    spelled `writeFileSync` inside `ccd/ccrc`. The task-scoped suite lists the plan wrote never ran that repo-wide
    guard, and the worker's first full run caught it (fixed as 3764).
  - **Routing: not escalated.** The miss is the plan's suite lists, not the worker's effort. An effort rung would
    not have run a guard nobody listed. The remedy is in the briefs: every later wave's brief names the repo-wide
    guards (the `single-definition` scans, `modelenv-single-writer`, `box-token-census`, `routing-references`) in
    each task's suite run.
  - **Review.** Review run 228 went to `ccrc-pwa-still-hollow`: the held-out panel, each lens given the plan's
    matching review item.
- **2026-10-02 — six items the worker raised for ruling.**
  1. Clause 16's triggers 1–2 are not bounded to "before wave-done", and clause 9 forbids a push after it. Spec §12
     names this, and stage 4's clause-9 exception closes it. Carried to stage 4.
  2. No coordinator step and no worker bullet describes a report-less fix round from `merging` (a land-sync, an
     ejection). Carried to stage 5, which owns ejection.
  3. The `update-branch` absence set leaves out `ccd/ccrc-*` helpers, `ccgpt-*` and `install-*.sh`. None spells the
     word today, so widening the set costs nothing and keeps it true as helpers are added. Ruled: widen it in
     wave 2.
  4. `main-red` over a window after #183 reads push runs that ran no test legs, because a merge to `main` runs no
     tests since the CI-selection design. Ruled: stage 2's re-measure counts trusted full runs only (daily, manual
     full, stable gate) and reports a window with none as unmeasured, never as green. Named cost: a one-day
     resolution on main's red intervals.
  5. Brief against plan on who assigns departure numbers: the brief governs, because it post-dates the plan and
     carries the issued block. The worker followed it.
  6. Commit trailers that name the authoring subagent's model are honest attribution and stay.
- **2026-10-02 — review 228 ruled: one fix round.**
  - **The panel:** three lenses, 63 agents, none unverified. 16 findings were confirmed, 4 refuted, and none left
    unexamined.
  - **The reviewer's checks:** 13 mutation rows re-ran red, the brief's suites were green, and 16 further repo-wide
    guards were green.
  - **CI:** the required Linux legs are green.
  - **The two important findings, both in the instrument:**
    - `inversions` reads GitHub before it refuses a missing `--fleet-login`;
    - `cmd_main_red`'s docstring claims to reproduce the archived 111.2 h, which the plan's own measurement says it
      does not.
  - **Ruled, fixed now:**
    - both important findings;
    - the hook's quadratic walk on `(` and `{` (it runs on every PreToolUse event, and D-3761 closed only the
      newline shape);
    - the instrument's cheap correctness gaps: the runs-list cap, uncounted inputs, a running re-run, `..` in a path;
    - restamp's failure message;
    - the I14 row text.

    The hook's false positives and misses are made true in its known-limits text, not changed in the regex. The fix
    round takes 3765 through 3767, one per group.
  - **Accepted:**
    - restamp's refusal is path-scoped, and a hard link defeats it; the operator is not an adversary, and the header
      will say so;
    - D-3761's restatement landed two commits after its definition; the tip is consistent and main squashes.
  - **Carried:** the report-less fix round, to stage 5.
- **2026-10-02 — wave 1's fix round done, in re-review.** The fresh wave-done (tip `db45cafc`) passed the server's
  re-measurement.
  - **Fixes:** four commits, then a clean merge of main `cf9e4cc8`. 3765 through 3767 are used, so the block is
    full.
  - **Rows:** 50 mutation rows red, none SKIPPED. The wave batch and the repo-wide guards passed, 790 tests, and the
    citation census reads stated=base=tree.
  - **The F3 trade:** no separator opens a quadratic walk any more (the 39 KB `(`/`{` payloads take 9–16 ms on the
    regex alone, down from 3.4–3.6 s). The cost is that a token holding `(` or `{` (`-C "$(pwd)"`, `-C ${WS}`) now
    ends the walk, so such a sync gets no advice.
  - **Re-review:** review run 232 judges that trade.
- **2026-10-02 — re-review 232 ruled: fix round 2.**
  - **The panel:** 7 confirmed, 2 refuted, collapsing to 5 distinct findings, all minor.
  - **Measured:** every ruling holds, and nine rows re-measured red. F3's whole-hook time fell from 4.7–9.8 s to
    about 105 ms.
  - **The F3 trade is proportionate.** Replayed over about 31 days of fleet Bash commands, the trade cost no real
    sync its advice: the 18 commands that lost it were mentions inside mail heredocs.
  - **Ruled:**
    - the closed-first read order is a stated guard, so it owes a pin;
    - name the delivered-then-parked mail in `undelivered`;
    - Step 8 prints the new counts;
    - restate H1, H2, H9, H14 and R4.

    Each extends D-3765 or D-3767, so no new number.
- **2026-10-02 — fix round 2 done, in re-review.**
  - **Fixes:** three commits (tip `e63e90e7`).
    - The closed-first read order is pinned (I25).
    - `undelivered` is named truly, with a rejected-at-close row in the counts case (I26).
    - Step 8 prints the new counts.
    - Each table header carries one snapshot.
  - **Rows:** I1–I26, R1–R10 and H1–H16 are all red, none SKIPPED.
  - **Re-review:** review run 235 went out with the held-out panel over `db45cafc..e63e90e7`.
- **Deviation blocks** are minted per wave, at that wave's run-open, by the coordinator. No `D-` token appears in
  this file until a plan on the same ref defines it (`deviation-refs.test.ts`).

## Carried constraints

- **CI test selection landed first (#183, `814fc53d`).** Wave 2's re-plan derives its `ci.yml` edits against that shape
  rather than overwriting it: a `merge_group` run keeps a run-unique concurrency group (never the shared push-to-main
  refresh group, which may drop runs), the mode table gains a `merge_group` row, the macOS legs and `full-suite` skip a
  queue run, and the queue runs the selected tests (ruling 2026-09-28).
- **The skill pins move with the clauses.** `worker-skill.test.ts`, `coordinator-skill.test.ts`, and the
  clause-count words in `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` that both pins read move in the same commit as a clause.
  session-continuity wave 8 appends its clauses after this programme's wave 1.
- **The hook is a contract, not an access boundary.** Identity on the fleet is attribution; the fleet's single
  GitHub login holds the admin role (R9).
- **From wave 1's rulings (2026-10-02).**
  - Wave 2 widens the `update-branch` absence set to `ccd/ccrc-*`, `ccgpt-*` and `install-*.sh`.
  - Stage 2's `main-red` counts trusted full runs only, and a window with none is unmeasured.
  - Stage 4 bounds clause 16's triggers 1–2 at wave-done through clause 9's exception.
  - Stage 5 writes the report-less fix round from `merging`.
  - Every brief names the repo-wide guards in each task's suite run.
  - **The sync advisory's spelling refinements (review 228 F4–F7).** A later landing wave owes:
    - silence for a main checkout updating itself, which is routine for coordinators;
    - a word in command position before `git`;
    - redirections glued to the target;
    - `~N`/`^N`, `refs/remotes/origin/main`, `main:main`.

    Each needs a pinned case and a timing check.
- **SAFETY.** Never a destructive `ccd` verb against the live host; never touch tmux, `~/.cc-sessions`,
  `~/.cc-limits` or `claude-session@*.service` directly; fixture HOMEs only in tests; `gh` stays off the exec
  whitelist; never print secret contents.

## Next-wave brief

Waves 1 and 2 are planned and reviewed; once the docs PR has merged, dispatch wave 1 on a fresh workspace with its
plan path and this file. Wave 2 needs wave 1's clause 15 to append its native-queue sentence to, and is dispatched
once wave 1 has merged; its dispatching coordinator re-measures Tasks 2–5 on the `main` it cuts the workspace from
(the plan's status block). After wave 2
merges, the operator applies the ruleset and approval change and runs the proof (spec §5.2 steps 2–3); wave 2b is
planned and dispatched only on that proof's result.
