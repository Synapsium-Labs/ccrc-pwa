// The run board's status vocabulary. Its OWN small table, deliberately not

// attention state, and reusing the bucket words would put attention-amber on a
// row nobody is waiting on — against DIRECTION.md's rule that a hue means the
// same thing everywhere.
//
// Two cues per row, always: the word is the fact and the glyph is the shape, so
// no state has to be read out of colour (StatusDot.tsx's own discipline).
