/**
 * Stable digest of a questions envelope's CONTENT — the first question's text
 * and its option labels, in order.
 *
 * This is the server-side twin of the correspondence gate `DialogSheet` got in
 * Build 1's fix wave: a client answers the question it was SHOWN, or it does
 * not answer. Content, not coordinates, so a re-render cannot forge it and a
 * reordered menu cannot silently redirect an answer to a different option.
 *
 * Approval envelopes deliberately have no key: they are answered through the
 * pane dialog path, where the rendered rows are the truth.
