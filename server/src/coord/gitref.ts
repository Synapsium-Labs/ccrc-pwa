 * The commit a branch points at, read from git's own ref files through

 * closed set `['tmux','ccd']` (`agent/src/whitelist.ts:134`) and widening it is
 * a three-edit, two-package, boot-audited change made deliberately or not at
 * all. The projects root IS readable (`whitelist.ts:82-88`), so the ref files
 * are.
 *
 * A WORKSPACE'S BRANCH LIVES IN THE MAIN REPO'S REF STORE, not in the worktree:
 * linked worktrees share `refs/` and keep only `HEAD` and their own
 * per-worktree refs under `.git/worktrees/<name>/`. So this reads
 * `<projectsRoot>/<project>/.git/refs/heads/<branch>`, then `packed-refs` —
 * loose first, which is the order git resolves in, and the reason the "prefers
 * the loose ref" case is pinned.
 *
 * `null` means UNMEASURABLE and callers must treat it as a refusal, never as a
 * mismatch and never as a pass: not knowing is not `[]` (`ccd/ccd:2018-2035`).
 * A `.git` this process cannot read, and a symref, are both null here — the
 * last deliberately, since resolving one is a second hop this does not need for
 * the one case it serves (a workspace branch).
