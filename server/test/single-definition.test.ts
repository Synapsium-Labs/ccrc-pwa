// were three. So the guard is a test that reads the sources, in the suite that
// already reaches outside its own package (`module-format.test.ts` walks
// `shared/`, the ccd tests execute `../../ccrc-portability/ccd`). A
// comment is a request; a red suite is a mechanism.
//
// These scan TEXT, deliberately, and that is a limitation worth stating: they
// catch the copy that looks like the original, which is the copy people
// actually write. A determined author can evade either one (build the object
// field-by-field, spell the union across a type alias in another file). The
// bar is "a reasonable person adding a fourth copy in the ordinary way is
// stopped before review", not "unforgeable".
