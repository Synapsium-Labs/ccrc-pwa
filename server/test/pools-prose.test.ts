// design measured as false (D-1685, D-1686, D-1687, D-1688).

// The shape is `readme-holds.test.ts`'s, for its reason as much as its form:
// slice the passage by its OWN markers and check it against the SOURCE it
// describes, never against a fixed sentence a future edit could silently
// falsify. Four times before this file existed, prose in this tree overclaimed
// and no assertion held it.
//
// Terminators are DISTINCTIVE literals, never `'\n### '` or `'\n- **'` —
// `ledger-instruction.test.ts`'s D-1443 lesson: `indexOf` stops at the FIRST
// closing anchor after the opener, so a generic terminator is matched by any new
// heading or bullet written INSIDE the region; the passage silently truncates,
// the length check is a lower bound a truncated passage still clears, and every
// negative assertion then passes over text that was cut away.
