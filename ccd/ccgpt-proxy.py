"""ccgpt-proxy — ccrc's front shim between Claude Code and the LiteLLM proxy
that fronts a ChatGPT/Codex subscription lane.

THIS IS THE MINIMAL FORM (gpt-lane-ownership plan 2a, Task 2). It binds a
port, answers its own identity, and forwards every other request untouched.
Later tasks in the same plan add request-body rewriting, but only on the
`/v1/messages` path — everything else this shim ever sees stays a pure
passthrough, forever.

Listens on 127.0.0.1:$CCGPT_PROXY_PORT; forwards to the LiteLLM proxy at
127.0.0.1:$CCGPT_LITELLM_PORT. No credentials are stored here — the
Authorization header passes through unexamined.

THE LANE'S NAME, ANSWERED LOCALLY. A caller asks GET /ccgpt/lane before it
trusts a listening shim port, because a port is only a number: two lanes can
have their proxy ports collide with something else entirely (a stray test
mock, another lane's leftover listener), and the only way to tell this
listener apart from one of those is to ask it who it is. The answer is the
account id this shim was started with — the same id a later task will use to
resolve this lane's own effort defaults and credentials. Plan 2b's adoption
check refuses to attach to a listener that answers a DIFFERENT lane's id.

THERE ARE NO DEFAULT PORTS OR LANE ID. `CCGPT_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CCGPT_PROXY_PORT`
and `CCGPT_LITELLM_PORT` are all required; a missing one is a refusal to
start, loudly, naming the variable — not a guessed port. A defaulted port is
the exact mechanism by which one lane's shim would silently reach another
lane's gateway and bill the wrong account.
